   AVISPA is a push-button tool for the automated validation of Internet
   security-sensitive protocols and applications. It provides a modular
   and expressive formal language for specifying protocols and
   their security properties, and integrates different back-ends that
   implement a variety of state-of-the-art automatic analysis
   techniques. To the best of our knowledge, no other tool exhibits the
   same level of scope and robustness while enjoying the same
   performance and scalability.}

   abstract = {There are considerable difficulties in the way of the development of useful and reliable simulation models of social phenomena, including that any simulation necessarily includes many assumptions that are not directly supported by evidence. Despite these difficulties, many still hope to develop quite general models of social phenomena. This paper argues that such hopes are ill-founded, in other words that there will be no short-cut to useful and reliable simulation models. However this paper argues that there is a way forward, that simulation modelling can be used to "boot-strap" useful knowledge about social phenomena. If each bit of simulation work can result in the rejection of some of the possible processes in observed social phenomena, even if this is about a very specific social context, then this can be used as part of a process of gradually refining our knowledge about such processes in the form of simulation models. Such a boot-strapping process will only be possible if simulation models are more carefully judged, that is a greater selective pressure is applied. In particular models which are just an analogy of social processes in computational form should be treated as "personal" rather than "scientific" knowledge.  Such analogical models are useful for informing the intuition of its developers and users, but do not help the community of social simulators and social scientists to "boot-strap" reliable social knowledge. However, it is argued that both participatory modelling and evidence-based modelling can play a useful part in this process. Some kinds of simulation model are discussed with respect to their suitability for the boot-strapping of social knowledge. The knowledge that results is likely to be of a more context-specific, conditional and mundane nature than many social scientists hope for.},

abstract = {This paper presents a graph-based approach to network vulnerability analysis. The method is flexible, allowing analysis of attacks from both outside and inside the network. It can analyze risks to a specific network asset, or examine the universe of possible consequences following a successful attack. The graph-based tool can identify the set of attack paths that have a high probability of success (or a low "effort" cost) for the attacker. The system could be used to test the effectiveness of making configuration changes, implementing an intrusion detection system, etc. The analysis system requires as input a database of common attacks, broken into atomic steps, specific network configuration and topology information, and an attacker profile. The attack information is "matched" with the network configuration information and an attacker profile to create a superset attack graph. Nodes identify a stage of attack, for example the class of machines the attacker has accessed and the user privilege level he or she has compromised. The arcs in the attack graph represent attacks or stages of attacks. By assigning probabilities of success on the arcs or costs representing level-of-effort for the attacker, various graph algorithms such as shortest-path algorithms can identify the attack paths with the highest probability of success.},

Manual attack graph construction is tedious, error-prone, and impractical for attack graphs larger than a hundred nodes. In this paper we present an automated technique for generating and analyzing attack graphs. We base our technique on symbolic model checking algorithms, letting us construct attack graphs automatically and efficiently. We also describe two analyses to help decide which attacks would be most cost-effective to guard against. We implemented our technique in a tool suite and tested it on a small network example, which includes models of a firewall and an intrusion detection system.},

In order to make airplane maintenance
procedures more efficient and thus save time
and costs, the distribution of airplane embedded
software will increasingly be performed
electronically over networks. Since such
software often implements vital functionality
while on the other hand communication
networks are inherently unreliable and
insecure, protecting the software distribution
process is critical, both from the safety and the
security perspective. Therefore an airplane
software distribution system must provide
protection guarantees which need to be verified
at a high assurance level.
     In this paper, we introduce a software
distribution system architecture with a generic
core component, such that the overall software
transport from the supplier to the airplane is an
interaction of several instances of this core
component communicating over insecure
networks. The main advantage of this
architecture is reduction of development and
certification costs. Further, we outline the
security evaluation of the proposed system
according to the Common Criteria (CC)
methodology and describe in detail our formal
model and verification of its main functionality
using the AVISPA tool. This mix of formal and
systematic informal methods is a key factor in
achieving high confidence in the security of the
software distribution system at moderate cost.

 abstract = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.}

  abstract = {Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a popular cryptographic algorithm that allows Internet protocols to agree on a shared key and negotiate a secure connection. It is fundamental to many protocols including HTTPS, SSH, IPsec, SMTPS, and protocols that rely on TLS.

We have uncovered several weaknesses in how Diffie-Hellman key exchange has been deployed:

Logjam attack against the TLS protocol. The Logjam attack allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to downgrade vulnerable TLS connections to 512-bit export-grade cryptography. This allows the attacker to read and modify any data passed over the connection. The attack is reminiscent of the FREAK attack, but is due to a flaw in the TLS protocol rather than an implementation vulnerability, and attacks a Diffie-Hellman key exchange rather than an RSA key exchange. The attack affects any server that supports DHE_EXPORT ciphers, and affects all modern web browsers. 8.4% of the Top 1 Million domains were initially vulnerable.

Threats from state-level adversaries. Millions of HTTPS, SSH, and VPN servers all use the same prime numbers for Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Practitioners believed this was safe as long as new key exchange messages were generated for every connection. However, the first step in the number field sieve—the most efficient algorithm for breaking a Diffie-Hellman connection—is dependent only on this prime. After this first step, an attacker can quickly break individual connections.

We carried out this computation against the most common 512-bit prime used for TLS and demonstrate that the Logjam attack can be used to downgrade connections to 80% of TLS servers supporting DHE_EXPORT. We further estimate that an academic team can break a 768-bit prime and that a nation-state can break a 1024-bit prime. Breaking the single, most common 1024-bit prime used by web servers would allow passive eavesdropping on connections to 18% of the Top 1 Million HTTPS domains. A second prime would allow passive decryption of connections to 66% of VPN servers and 26% of SSH servers. A close reading of published NSA leaks shows that the agency's attacks on VPNs are consistent with having achieved such a break.}

ProVerif. This verifier can prove secrecy, authentication, and

of cryptographic primitives defined by rewrite rules or by equations.
The tool takes as input a description of the protocol to verify in a
process calculus, an extension of the pi calculus with
cryptography. It automatically translates this protocol into an abstract
representation of the protocol by Horn clauses, and determines whether
the desired security properties hold by resolution on these clauses.}

abstract = "We consider $\mu$L, $\mu$La, and $\mu$Lp, three variants of the first-order Î¼-calculus studied in verification of data-aware processes, that differ in the form of quantification on objects across states. Each of these three logics has a distinct notion of bisimulation. We show that the three notions collapse for generic dynamic systems, which include all state-based systems specified using a logical formalism, e.g., the situation calculus. Hence, for such systems, Î¼L, Î¼La, and Î¼Lp have the same expressive power. We also show that, when the dynamic system stores only a bounded number of objects in each state (e.g., for bounded situation calculus action theories), a finite abstraction can be constructed that is faithful for $\mu$L (the most general variant), yielding decidability of verification. This contrasts with the undecidability for first-order ltl, and notably implies that first-order ltl cannot be captured by $\mu$L."

abstract="In the area of networks, a common method to enforce a security policy expressed in a high-level language is based on an ad-hoc and manual rewriting process [24]. We argue that it is possible to build a formal link between concrete and abstract terms, which can be dynamically computed from the environment data. In order to progressively introduce configuration data and then simplify the proof obligations, we use the B refinement process. We present a case study modeling a network monitor. This program, described by refinement following the layers of the TCP/IP suite protocol, has to warn for all observed events which do not respect the security policy. To design this model, we use the event-B method because it is suitable for modeling network concepts.",

abstract="We address the proof-based development of (system) models satisfying a security policy. The security policy is expressed in a model called OrBAC, which allows one to state permissions and prohibitions on actions and activities and belongs to the family of role-based access control formalisms. The main question is to validate the link between the security policy expressed in OrBAC and the resulting system; a first abstract B model is derived from the OrBAC specification of the security policy and then the model is refined to introduce properties that can be expressed in OrBAC. The refinement guarantees that the resulting B (system) model satisfies the security policy. We present a generic development of a system with respect to a security policy and it can be instantiated later for a given security policy.",
